An endless vortex of eyes staring appeared before you. Before you could even let out a shout, you were swallowed by the endlessly writhing doorway. 

That was the last thing you remembered.

By the time you regained consciousness, a blonde woman dressed in a strange attire had sat before you. She crossed her legs, stifling a yawn as she gazed down before your form. 

You could instantly tell this was no ordinary lady. The demeanour of a ruler with eyes that seemed to suck one into the endless stream of time. 

As your mouth hung agape, she spoke up, @@.yukari;"You're awake? Good."@@

She got up from her seat and took several steps towards you. You quickly backed off from her; however, no matter how much you kicked against the ground, your body refused to move. I could only watch as she came closer and closer. 

Bearing her cold gaze upon you, she asked, @@.yukari;"What is your name?"@@

@@.yukari;"$player.name huh?"@@ the woman asked. She took a couple of steps back, and began circling you. 

She kept at a distance of about two metres, her heels clacking against the ground every second or so. 

Seeing that she was momentarily distracted, you began checking on yourself.

The woman stopped, leaned over my back and took a sniff. You could feel the increased warmth from her as her cold hands clasped themselves on your shoulder.
A short sniff, probably around 5 seconds, yet it felt like an eternity as your heart rate sped up. 

She clasped her nose and walked backwards away from me. @@.yukari; You smell disgusting.@@

"Me?" You uttered, as she fanned herself while pinching her nose. 

@@.yukari;I doubt any Youkai would want to eat you.@@

"..." Knowing better, you kept silent. You wanted to know more about the situation your in, but that could wait. 

@@.yukari;Since you got two hands and legs, it would be a waste to just let you go.@@

She raised a hand and snapped her fingers. That same void that brought me into this room reappeared, \
and you swallowed into the murky abyss, with those eyes staring at you as your consciousness melted in the void.

Disoriented, you slowly oriented yourself and saw that blond woman petting the head of a zombie.

@@.yoshika;Who's that? Is he my supper?@@

@@.yoshika;You better bring me something good or I'll report you to Mistress Seiga!@@

@@.yukari; That's why this human comes in.@@

The blonde threw a tool to you. You leapt out of the way as it hit the ground with a clang. \
Picking it up under the moonlight of the full moon, you could see that it is a shovel.

@@.yukari;It's time for you to dig up some food. I wonder how fermented humans taste like.@@ 

The woman licked her lips with her tongue.

You shuddered.

"Fuck no! I'm not going to listen to you!"

The woman sighed.

@@.yukari;Would you rather be served to Yoshika? I'm not asking you to kill someone. I'm only asking you to \
dig up some graves, is it really so hard?@@

Resting her chin against her hands as her lower half sat in the void, she smiled.
