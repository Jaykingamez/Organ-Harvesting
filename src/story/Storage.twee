:: Storage

The storage room is a strange place. Reminiscent of your old world's hospitals, it lacked the constant smell of sceptic wafting in the air. 
It even was cool to the touch. It could fool anyone with such an image, except for the glaring hatch in the middle of the room. 

If you have any... patients, they stay in their beds, glaring daggers at you, their all so wonderful saviour. The ones which you have used your breaking methods on
could only look away, hoping to not suffer from your treatment. 

Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play.
